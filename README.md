To test my knowledge of machine learning and interest in the intersection between finance/technology, I created a stock price predictor leveraging Python/PyTorch. This model is 85% using techniques like back propogation, avoiding overfitting, etc. Please run this google colab notebook to test as the web development will resume later.
